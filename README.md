# Mars Visit Application

## Project Overview
The Mars Visit Application is designed to collect and validate user information for a hypothetical trip to Mars. It consists of multiple form stages where users can input their personal information, contact details, and travel dates.

## Features
- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Fields are dynamically generated using a template system.
- **Validation**: Both client-side validation (e.g., email, phone number) and custom validation (e.g., date logic) are implemented.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts to different screen sizes and ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Unit Testing**: The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate the core functionalities.

## File Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.
- **styles.css**: Contains the styling for the application, ensuring it is visually appealing.
- **formFields.js**: Manages the dynamic creation of form fields and validation logic.
- **fieldValidation.js**: Contains reusable validation functions used across the application.
- **main.js**: Handles stage switching, form initialization, and event listener management.
- **main.test.js**: Contains the Jest unit tests for validating the core functions.

## Running the Project
To view the application, open `index.html` in a web browser. All necessary scripts are included, so the application should work without any additional setup.

## Running Unit Tests
- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.
- Run the tests using the command: `npm test`.

## Known Issues
- Due to time constraints, some parts of the project might not have full test coverage. However, the provided tests should demonstrate the necessary skills.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the unit test coverage to include more edge cases.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a demonstration of my front-end development skills, particularly in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and unit testing. I believe it reflects my ability to create dynamic and responsive applications with robust validation and testing strategies.
